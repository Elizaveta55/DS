        "Hidden Markov models are a form of structured prediction method that are popular for tagging all elements in a sequence with some \"hidden\" state. They can be thought of as extensions of Markov chains where, instead of the probability of the next observation being dependant on the current observation, the probability of the next hidden state is dependant on the current hidden state, and the next observation is derived from that hidden state. An example of this can be part of speech tagging, where the observations are words and the hidden states are parts of speech. Each word gets tagged with a part of speech, but dynamic programming is utilized to search through all potential word-tag combinations to identify the best set of tags across the entire sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another perspective of HMMs is that they are an extension on mixture models that includes a transition matrix. Conceptually, a mixture model has a set of \"hidden\" states---the mixture components---and one can calculate the probability that each sample belongs to each component. This approach treats each observations independently. However, like in the part-of-speech example we know that an adjective typically is followed by a noun, and so position in the sequence matters. A HMM adds a transition matrix between the hidden states to incorporate this information across the sequence, allowing for higher probabilities of transitioning from the \"adjective\" hidden state to a noun or verb.\n",

We can say that regions of the genome that are enriched for nucleotides 'C' and 'G' are 'CG islands', which is a simplification of the real biological concept but sufficient for our example. The issue with identifying these regions is that they are not exclusively made up of the nucleotides 'C' and 'G', but have some 'A's and 'T's scatted amongst them. A simple model that looked for long stretches of C's and G's would not perform well, because it would miss most of the real regions.\n",

Other cases have a lower probability of staying in the same state, like the part of speech tagger. A part of the transition matrix is the start probabilities, which is the probability of starting in each of the hidden states.
